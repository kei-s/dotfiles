==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*outputz-introduction*

*outputz* is a Vim plugin to provide the feature that the number of bytes you
inputted will be automatically posted to outputz.com whenever a whole buffer
is written to a file.

Note that this is just a prototype.  The interface should be improved for the
future.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- curl - http://curl.haxx.se/




==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*outputz-interface*

g:outputz_secret_key	(string)		*g:outputz_secret_key*
			Your secret key for outputz.com.

g:outputz_uri_function	(string)		*g:outputz_uri_function*
			The name of a function which is used to generate the
			URI to be sent to outputz.com.  This function will be
			called with no argument.  The default value is
			"outputz#default_uri_function" which generate URI as
			follows:
>
			call outputz#default_uri_function()
			"==> 'vim://{filetype}'
<
			Where {filetype} is the value of 'filetype' for the
			buffer to being written.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*outputz-bugs*

- Whenever a part of a buffer is written to a file, the size of your output
  will not be sent to outputz.com.  Because there is no way to calculate the
  size of your output in the written part.

- There are many bugs around the world.
